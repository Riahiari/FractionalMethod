# Deconvolution Folder
There is a missing folder known as the Deconvolution folder. This folder is specifically used for the denoising of absorption spectra. It involves a wavelet denoising algorithm developed by Diop. M. et. al. It will have to be downloaded separately. Otherwise, simply go into the "GetConcsFromAbsorptions" file and get rid of the denoising line. Maybe use sgolayfilt or implement your own wavelet denoising.
